# Udagram Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three main parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework (udagram-frontend/)
2. Backend RESTful API for users - Node-Express application (udagram-user/)
3. Backend RESTful API for feeds - Node-Express application (udagram-feed/)

It also uses a reverse proxy to integrate all the API backend calls in a single logic point (reverse-proxy/).

## Getting Started
> This repository contains all the configuration files needed to:
1. Create docker images for all the APIs.
2. Automate the creation and push of docker images using travis CI.
3. Configuration files for deployments and services in Kubernetes.

### Prerequisite
1. The depends on the Node Package Manager (NPM). You will need to download and install Node from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will allow you to be able to run `npm` commands.
2. Environment variables will need to be set. These environment variables include database connection details that should not be hard-coded into the application code.

#### Environment Script
A file named `set_env.sh` has been prepared as an optional tool to help you configure these variables on your local development environment.

### Database
Create a PostgreSQL database either locally or on AWS RDS. Set the config values for environment variables prefixed with `POSTGRES_` in `set_env.sh`.

### S3
Create an AWS S3 bucket. Set the config values for environment variables prefixed with `AWS_` in `set_env.sh`.

### Backend APIs
* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-user/` and `udagram-feed/`:
    ```bash
    npm install .
    ```
* To run the application locally, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
* You can visit `http://localhost:8080/api/v0/feed` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a JSON payload. Feel free to play around with Postman to test the API's.

### Frontend App
* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-frontend/`:
    ```bash
    npm install .
    ```
* Install Ionic Framework's Command Line tools for us to build and run the application:
    ```bash
    npm install -g ionic
    ```
* Prepare your application by compiling them into static files.
    ```bash
    ionic build
    ```
* Run the application locally using files created from the `ionic build` command.
    ```bash
    ionic serve
    ```
* You can visit `http://localhost:8100` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a web interface.
